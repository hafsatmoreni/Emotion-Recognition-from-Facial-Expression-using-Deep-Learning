# Emotion-Recognition-from-Facial-Expression-using-Deep-Learning
This deep learning project focuses on the classification of different facial expression images to detect emotions 

In this study, we propose a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for facial emotion 
recognition. The model's hyperparameters are tuned using RandomizedSearchCV, with a focus 
on accuracy as the primary performance metric. The results are then compared with two 
previous studies that employed EfficientNet-Lite models for facial emotion recognition. 
Although the proposed SVM model achieves a validation accuracy of 74.93%, it 
underperforms compared to the over 90% accuracy rates reported in the existing literature. 
Recommendations for future research include exploring alternative architectures and refining 
hyperparameters to improve model performance.
